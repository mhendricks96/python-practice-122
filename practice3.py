# Description:      Calculates how many gumballs will fill a cylinder jar
# Input:            diameter as float, height as float
# Output:           number of gumballs as int

# Sample Run:

# Gumball Estimator!

# tell you how many gumballs it will take to fill!

# Enter cylinder diameter (inches): 7
# Enter cylinder height (inches): 10

# The jar will hold 477 gumballs!

# Goodbye!
